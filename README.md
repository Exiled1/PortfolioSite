# PortfolioSite
 This is where I'm currently coding my portfolio site, so this is gonna have my resume, github, and other stuff like projects I'm currently working on.

## Frameworks and libraries used:
- Gatsby.js (Frontend framework for building, deploying, hosting, and managing websites)
- Anime.js (An animation library that I've been wanting to use for a very long time.)
- React (A js library for user interfaces.)
- NPM (Package manager)
- Sass (CSS manager)
